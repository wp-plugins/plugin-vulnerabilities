Alerts when installed plugins contain known security vulnerabilities. Also lists vulnerabilities that exist in other versions of installed plugins.

== Description ==

This plugin checks the plugins you have installed against a list of verified security vulnerabilities. If the installed version of a plugin is vulnerable an alert is added to the Installed Plugins page, otherwise details of the vulnerabilities are included on the Plugin Vulnerabilities page.

This plugin is most important use is to protect against website being hacked, but it is also helpful when working to determine how a website was hacked during the cleanup process of the hacked website. If your website has been hacked we can [help you to clean and secure it](https://www.whitefirdesign.com/services/hacked-wordpress-website-cleanup.html).

Because we verify each vulnerability before including it not all known vulnerabilities are included, but we are increasing the number of included vulnerabilities on a regular basis.

If you want to let us know of a missing vulnerability or if we need to correct something in an included vulnerability, please leave a message in the support forum or send an email to pluginvulnerabilities@whitefirdesign.com. For missing vulnerabilities please include a link to the details of the vulnerability.
